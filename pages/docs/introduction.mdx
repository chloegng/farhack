# Introduction

## Welcome to FarHack at FarCon!
We're so excited to welcome you to **FarHack at FarCon**, taking place from May 3 - 5 in Venice Beach, CA.
This is the ultimate Farcaster hackathon to learn how to build cool Farcaster sh*t with cool Farcaster people — with 24 hours to start building it and all the hands-on support you may need.

This website is our **Hacking Guide**  — your one stop shop to learn about Farcaster development, from making your first cast all the way to creating a cross-platform client.

Have any questions along the way? Feel free to reach out to myself([@dylsteck.eth](https://warpcast.com/dylsteck.eth)) or tag [@farhack](https://warpcast.com/farhack) on Farcaster and we'll get back to you shortly!
