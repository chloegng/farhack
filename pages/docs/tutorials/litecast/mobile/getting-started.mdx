# Getting started

[Litecast](https://litecast.xyz) is a lightweight, open-source Farcaster client that I've been working on.
<br/> The app uses [Neynar](https://neynar.com) for authentication / data retrieval and features two separate repos: <br /> - a [Next.js web app](https://github.com/dylsteck/litecast/web) <br/> - an [Expo / React Native mobile app](https://github.com/dylsteck/litecast).

This tutorial is going to walk you through the codebase and show you how different parts of the stack work so you can remix the building blocks and make whatever Farcaster client you want!

### Prerequisites
In order to follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have the following installed(we'll get to more package installs later): <br /> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) <br/> - [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
